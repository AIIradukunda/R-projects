# Machine Learning with R

- The puprose of ML is to make machines more self-sufficient so that they are able to analyze data , recognize pattern, automate processes and make them more efficient 
- Statistical Modelling is a subfield of math that deals with finding relationships between
variables to predict outcomes.

# Supervised learning

Teach the model with labeled dataset, then with that knowledge have it predict future instances

#  types of SL

- Classification : organizing/classify labeled data
- Regression : predict trends using labeled data to determine future outcomes
#   K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (K-NN or KNN) is a supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
  
# Unsupervised learning

We do not supervise the model, but we let the model work on its own to discover information that may not be visible to the human eye.  -- uses UNLABELED data.
Unsupervised Learning usually deals with algorithms that utilize centroids.

Some of these algorithms include:
-  K-means clustering,
-  Hierarchical clustering
- Density-based clustering

Clustering( unspervised learning type) is the analysis of patterns and groupings of unlabeled data.

Out-of-sample data means data that is outside of the dataset used to train the model.
